<p>If you have ever wondered how a webpage is made, then this is the page for you! In this page, I will tell you how I made the webpage I made for this project.</p>
<h1>About What I Made</h1>
<p>For this project, I made a webpage about myself and what I learned while doing the project and I also made the page you are on now, a page about some specific things I learned and also how those things work.</p>
<h1>Programming Skills I Learned</h1>
<p>In this section, I will talk about some of the programming skills I learned over the two weeks I worked on this project.</p>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>HTML is the base programming language for most webpages. It creates the basic outline of the website; the text, headers, lists, etc. All of these things are customizable using CSS, which I will talk about later in this page. This section will talk about different parts of HTML and explain hpw they work and what they do.</p>
<h3>HTML Tags</h3>
<p>There are many different tags in HTML. In this section, I will go over some of them and explain what they do. A tag is what tells the code what to do to in the webpage. All tags have an opening and closing tag. An opening tag looks like this: &lt;p1&gt; and a closing tag looks like this: &lt;/p1&gt;. You'll notice that the closing tag has a forward slash at the beginning of it. This is what makes it a closing tag instead of an opening tag. An opening tag is what signals the beginning of a certain piece of code and a closing tag is what signals the end of that code.</p>
<h4>Paragraph Tag</h4>
<p>A paragraph tag is used to create text in an HTML page. The text you are reading right now was created using a paragraph tag. A paragraph tag looks like this: &lt;p1&gt;.</p>
<h4>Unordered List Tag</h4>
<p>An unordered list tag is used to create a list with bullet points in an HTML page.</p>
<div class="center">
<ul>
    <li>This is an unordered list</li>
    <li>The opening tag for an unordered list looks like this: &lt;ul&gt;</li>
    <li>The closing tag looks like this: &lt;/ul&gt;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>Ordered List Tag</h4>
<p>An ordered list tag is used to create a list with ordered numbers in an HTML page.</p>
<div class="center">
<ol>        
    <li>This an ordered list</li>
    <li>The opening tag for an ordered list looks like this: &lt;ol&gt;</li>
    <li>The closing tag for an ordered list looks like this: &lt;/ol&gt;</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h4>List Item Tag</h4>
<p>A list item tag is used to create items for a list in an HTML page. The opening and closing tags are &lt;li&gt; and &lt;/li&gt;.</p>
<div class="center">
<ul><li>This is a list item</li></ul>
<ol><li>A list item can also be part of a numbered list</li></ol>
</div>
<h3>HTML Headers</h3>
<p>A header in HTML is used to separate different sections in an HTML page. The header tags follow the same general format as all other tags in HTML. There are six different header sizes, from 1 being the largest and 6 being the smallest. They all follow the format of &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;, where you change the numbers according to what size you want.</p>
<h1>This is a Size 1 Header</h1>
<h2>This is a Size 2 Header</h2>
<h3>This is a Size 3 Header</h3>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>CSS is a programming language that is used in conjunction with other languages like HTML to create the aesthetics of a webpage; colors, borders, margins, etc. In this section, I will talk about some specific CSS skills I learned and how they are used to make webpages look nice.</p>
<h3>Text Color</h3>
<p>
In CSS, one of the most common things you can do is to change the color of text in a webpage. For example, the following code in CSS would change all of the paragraph text in the page to white:<br>
p{<br>
    color: white;<br>
}
</p>
<h3>Background Color</h3>
<p>Another easy thing you can do is to change the background color of your webpage. you can also change the background of paragraphs, headers, etc. For example, the following code in CSS would change the background color of all the paragraphs to black<br>
p{<br>
background-color:black;<br>
}
</p>
<h3>Border Style</h3>
<p>The border style is the way the borders around headers, paragraphs, pages, etc. looks. For example, a border can be dotted, solid, dotted, dashed, etc. The following code will create a solid border around all of the paragraphs in a webpage.<br>
p{<br>
border-style:solid;<br>
}
</p>
<h3>Border Color</h3>
<p>The border color is exactly what it sounds like. In the following code, I will set the border around all paragraphs to be white.<br>
p{<br>
border-color:white;<br>
}
</p>
