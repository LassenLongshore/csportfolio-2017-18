<h1>About what I made</h1>
<p>For this round of Expeditions, the goal was to use <a href="arthowto.html">Javascript</a> (JS) in conjunction with HTML to make an interactive 
website that solves a problem. The problem I chose to solve was not having an easy to use, customizable, weekly planner.</p>
<h1>How I used HTML and JS in conjunction</h1>
<p>In order to use the JS and HTML in conjunction, I had to use something called the DOM. DOM stands for Document Object Model, and, at a very basic
level, it provides the ability to use multiple programming languages in one document. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-1/introduction.html">
Click here</a> for a more detailed explanation of the DOM.</p>
<h1>How the project works</h1>
<p>In order to change the title of the week, you put the desired title in to the first text box and then click the button next to it. For example,
if the week I wanted to put in the planner was the week of the 1st, I'd put "Week of 2/1" in to the text box and click the button. This would 
change the week title to "Week of 2/1". The actual calendar bit is a little different. The calendar has 7 days (Monday through Sunday) and each
day has 6 slots that you can put items in to. To do this, you must first select the desired day and slot from the provided selectors. Then you can
put in your to do item in to the text box and then click the Update Day button.</p>
<h1>Specific pieces of code & how they work</h1>
<p>
CODE EXAMPLE 1<br>
//checks if the day input button is clicked<br>
dayInputButton.addEventListener("click", function(){<br>
    //checks the selections for the day of the week and position of the calendar<br>
    if (typeSelector.value === "monday" && position.value === "1"){<br>
        //then changes the position of that cell in the calendar to whatever is in the input box<br>
        m1.innerHTML = dayInput.value;<br>
    }<br>
    if (typeSelector.value === "monday" && position.value === "2"){<br>
        m2.innerHTML = dayInput.value;<br>
    }<br>
This is part of the block of code that checks which day and which cell you chose, and it changes the text of that particular selection to whatever 
you put in the text box. The function itself is actually much longer, because there are seven days with six cells each, for a total of 42 cells. 
Unfortunately, there is no way to do it except create an if-statement for each and every cell in the calendar.<br>
CODE EXAMPLE 2<br>
&lt;select name=&quot;typeSelector&quot; id=&quot;typeSelector&quot;&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/option&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/option&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/option&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/option&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/option&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;saturday&quot;&gt;Saturday&lt;/option&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;sunday&quot;&gt;Sunday&lt;/option&gt;<br>
    &lt;/select&gt;<br>
    &lt;select id=&quot;position&quot;&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;<br>
        &lt;option value=&quot;6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/option&gt;<br>
    &lt;/select&gt;<br>
These are the blocks of code that create the selectors for the day and position. The first block creates the selector for the day of the week, and 
the second block creates the selector for the cell number.

<h1>Some choices I made</h1>
<p>Some choices I had to make were what to make, how customizable to make it, and what colors to make it. I chose to make what I made because I had
done something similar in a previous interval and I drew inspiration from that. I decided on how customizable to make it by considering all of the
things that a potential user might want to change. I chose the colors I did for two reasons. One was that I already had the CSS for the other web 
pages, and the other was that I like consistency.</p>
<h1>Change of understanding</h1>
<p>This project has changed my understanding of what it means to interact with something. Before I started this project, I had been on hundreds of 
websites, and I had never really thought about how I interacted with them, like putting text in a box, or clicking a button and having something 
happen in response. Over the course of this project, I came to realize that interactions were simply inputs and outputs working together. For 
example, click the week input button, and the week title changes.</p>
<h1>If I had more time</h1>
<p>If I had more time, I would make it so that instead of just six cells, it would expand to meet the needs of the user. I would also add a "Clear 
All" button so that it is easy to start over with a new calendar.</p>
