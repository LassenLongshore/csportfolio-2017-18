    <h1>About what I made</h1>
    <p>For this project, I made a piece of generative art using Javascript. I also made the page you are on now, a page about how I made the art
    piece. I made the art piece using a programming language called Javascript.</p>
    <h1>About Javascript</h1>
    <p>Javascript is a programming language that is primarily used for animations and other such things. It is often used in conjunction with HTML
    and CSS to produce World Wide Web content (webpages). It is also mainly used to produce things like video games.</p>
    <h1>How the project works overall</h1>
    <p>The project consists of four quadrants of different colors. Each quadrant is made up of 49 smaller squares. When you move the mouse around on
    the canvas, random squares on the canvas are colored black for a second, then they turn back into the original color.</p>
    <h1>Specific pieces code and how they work</h1>
    <p>Some specific pieces of code I used are if statements and functions.</p>
    <h2>If statements</h2>
    <p>An if statement checks if a condition is true, and if it is, it runs a specific piece, or block, of code. An if statement looks like this:<br>
    if (i >= 190){<br>
    fill(255, 200, 145);<br>
    <br>
    }<br>
    This piece of code checks if the mouse's X position
    </p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>A function assigns certain actions to a function keyword, and when ever that function keyword is called, it executes that function. 
    For example:<br>
    drawSquares = function(x, y){<br>
    stroke(0, 0, 0);<br>
    fill(0, 0, 0);<br>
    rect(x, y, 28.4, 28.4);<br>
    };<br>
    This piece of code creates a function called drawSquares, and set that function to draw a square that is whit in color, has a white border, 
    and is 28.4 pixels wide by 28.4 pixels high.</p>
    <h1>Choices I made about the art</h1>
    <p>Some choices I made about the art were what colors to use, what shapes to use, what way the shapes were laid out on the page, and how to add
    interaction to the page. I decided what colors to use by going on to an RGB color picker and mixing and matching different colors until I found
    a good combination of four colors. I decided to use squares in a grid pattern because I like how squares are uniform in every way and how they
    form a perfectly lined up grid. I chose to have random squares appear and disappear by drawing inspiration from another student's project from
    another school. I also had to decide how long the squares stay on the screen before disappearing. I decided this by playing around with 
    different delays and picking the one I thought was the best.</p>
    <h1>Some things I learned</h1>
    <p>One thing I learned is how to find things out for myself instead of going to the teacher straight away. In class, we're supposed to ask the
    internet first, a classmate second, and if both of those don't work, then we ask the teacher. This has helped teach me to be more independent 
    in my learning.</p>
    <h1>How I could improve my project</h1>
    <p>Given more time, I might make different shapes appear instead of squares. I might make more types of shapes appear along with the squares,
    or maybe change the color scheme. I could also make it so that shapes are drawn wherever the mouse pointer is.</p>
